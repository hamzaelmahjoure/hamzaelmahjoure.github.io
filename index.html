                            <p> <b> Abstract : </b> In this paper, we consider a fractional SIS epidemic system with logistic growth demographic and saturated incidence rate for susceptibles. First, we validate our model by proving the global existence, positivity as well as boundedness of solutions. Then, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the extinction and persistence of the disease from the population. We also study the local asymptotic stability of the unique positive equilibrium point by analyzing the corresponding characteristic equation. We find that combining logistic growth and saturated incidence for susceptibles can lead the system dynamic behavior to exhibit stability switches. By choosing the growth rate and the carrying capacity of the population as the bifurcation parameters, the stability of the positive equilibrium and the existence of Hopf bifurcation are investigated. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to verify the theoretical results, to fit real-time data from 10 June to 25 November of 2020 and also to predict the number of cumulative cases for COVID-19 in Morocco during 2021.</p>

                            <p> <b> Abstract : </b> In this paper, we revisit the classical SIR epidemic model by replacing the simple bilinear transmission rate by a nonlinear one. Our results show that in the presence of environmental fluctuations represented by Brownian motion and that mainly act on the transmission rate, the generalized non-concave force of infection adopted here, greatly affects the long-time behavior of the epidemic. Employing the Markov semigroup theory, we prove that the model solutions do not admit a unique stationary distribution but converge to 0 in pth moment for any p>0. Furthermore, we prove that the disease extinguishes asymptotically exponentially with probability 1 without any restriction on the model parameters and we also determine the rate of convergence. This is an unexpected qualitative behavior in comparison with the existing literature where the studied epidemic models have a threshold dynamics behavior. It is also a very surprising behavior regarding the deterministic counterpart that can exhibit a rich qualitative dynamical behaviors such as backward bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation. On the other hand, we show by several numerical simulations that as the intensity of environmental noises becomes sufficiently small, the epidemic tends to persist for a very long time before dying out from the host population. To solve this problem and to be able to manage the pre-extinction period, we construct a new process in terms of the number of infected and recovered individuals which admits a unique invariant stationary distribution. Finally, we discuss the obtained analytical results through a series of numerical simulations. </p>

Alternatively, the system admits a unique endemic equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable if R<sub>0</sub> > 1. Moreover, we investigate the case when R<sub>0</sub> = 1.
